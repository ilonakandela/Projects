# Bank Customer Churn Prediction
### Project Description
The model leverages key customer attributes such as age, gender, account balance, credit score, and product usage to pinpoint the primary drivers of churn. By identifying these factors, the bank can prioritize high-risk segments, such as customers in regions with elevated churn rates or those showing behavioral signs of dissatisfaction. Additionally, the analysis uncovers actionable insights, such as the impact of inactivity, overuse of products, and demographic vulnerabilities, allowing for the development of personalized engagement strategies. These targeted initiatives not only help in retaining valuable clients but also enhance overall customer experience and loyalty, contributing to long-term business sustainability.

### Key Aspects 
- **Objective:** Predict customer churn probabilities to minimize client losses and improve loyalty.
- **Methodology:** Analyze customer data across geographic, demographic, behavioral, and financial dimensions using Python and classification models to build a predictive model.
- **Tools:** Python (pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn)
- **Outcome:** Achieved 95% model accuracy, enabling the bank to identify high-risk customers and apply targeted retention strategies.

### Project Insights
- **Geographical Differences.** Germany exhibits the highest churn rate (32%), requiring region-specific retention strategies.
- **Demographics.** Higher churn risk is observed among women and customers aged 50â€“60, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions.
- **Behavioral Patterns.** Inactive customers show a significantly higher churn rate, and clients with three or more products tend to express dissatisfaction.
- **Financial Factors.** Customers with high account balances are more likely to leave, highlighting the importance of premium services to secure their loyalty.
