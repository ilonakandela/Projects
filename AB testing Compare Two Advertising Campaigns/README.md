### Project Description
Project involves conducting an A/B test between two different advertising strategies—static ads (control campaign) and motion ads (test campaign) — to evaluate their impact on key performance metrics such as click-through rates (CTR), conversion rates (CR), cost per acquisition (CPA), purchase rates, etc. By analyzing the campaign's performance, the project seeks to provide actionable insights for optimizing advertising strategies to maximize return on investment (ROI).

### Key Aspects 
- **A/B Testing Approach:** Statistical testing to evaluate performance differences between the two ad types.
- **Objective:** Determine which ad type yields better user engagement and conversion outcomes.
- **Methodology:** The A/B test aims to determine which advertising approach — static or motion ads — performs better in driving user engagement, conversions, and overall campaign effectiveness, with key business metrics.
- **Tools:** Python (pandas, numpy, plotly, seaborn, scipy).
- **Outcome** reveals that motion ads drive higher engagement and clicks, while static ads are more effective at converting those interactions into purchases, suggesting a balanced approach may optimize both brand awareness and conversions.

### Project Insights
- Higher Engagement: Motion ads generated significantly more clicks and a higher CTR, indicating stronger user engagement.
- Cost-Effectiveness: Static ads had a lower CPM, making them more cost-effective for delivering impressions.
- Conversion Performance: Static ads were more effective at converting clicks into purchases and encouraging users to add products to their carts.
- Purchase Behavior: Motion ads showed higher user interaction but lower purchase conversions, suggesting that while motion ads increase interest, they may require refinement to optimize conversions.
- Campaign Strategy: The results suggest a potential strategy of using both static and motion ads, with static ads focusing on conversions and motion ads enhancing engagement and brand awareness.
