# Annual Sales Performance Analysis and Dashboard

### Project Description:
The project provides a comprehensive analysis of the company's sales data for 2023, highlighting revenue distribution across categories, occasions, and cities. It examines key performance indicators such as average order value and delivery times while identifying top-performing products and revenue-driving occasions. The insights aim to uncover trends, optimize strategies, and support informed decision-making for future growth.

### Key Business Insights:
- **Revenue Concentration:** With 70% of revenue driven by top 3 categories: Colors, Soft Toys, and Sweets, with peak sales during key occasions like Anniversary, All Occasions and Raksha Bandhan (together it generates 54% of total revenue). Focusing resources on these areas can maximize profit.
