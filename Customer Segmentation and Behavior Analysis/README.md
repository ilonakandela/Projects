### Project Description
The project aims to enhance customer understanding and retention by analyzing purchasing behavior using cohort analysis, RFM segmentation, and k-means clustering. By segmenting customers based on recency, frequency, and monetary metrics, businesses can tailor their marketing efforts to target high-value customers and re-engage inactive ones. The cohort analysis reveals patterns in customer behavior over time, while RFM segmentation identifies key customer groups. K-means clustering provides deeper insights into distinct customer clusters, enabling more personalized marketing strategies for each segment, ultimately improving customer loyalty and lifetime value.

### Key Aspects
- **Objective:** Identify distinct customer segments and tailor marketing strategies for improved engagement and retention.
- **Methodology:**
  - Cohort analysis to examine customer behavior over time and identify seasonal trends.
  - RFM analysis to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior.
  - K-means clustering to group customers into distinct clusters based on RFM scores.
- **Tools:** Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn)
- **Outcome:** Improved understanding of customer groups and enhanced marketing targeting strategies to boost engagement and loyalty

### Project Insights
- Cohort analysis revealed that the highest revenue came from customers acquired in December, with a strong seasonal impact around the New Year period.
- RFM segmentation revealed that while "Loyal Customers" contribute significantly to revenue, "Inactive Customers" dominate the customer base, highlighting the need for targeted re-engagement strategies to boost overall retention and revenue.
- K-means clustering provided deeper insights into customer segments, allowing for more personalized marketing strategies and enabling businesses to target the most valuable customers effectively.
