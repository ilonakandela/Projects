# Project Description
This project focused on analyzing and optimizing the traffic flow of an e-commerce platform to enhance user engagement and drive higher conversions. Leveraging data from multiple sources, the analysis explored traffic behavior across devices, regions, product categories, and channels to identify inefficiencies in the user journey. Using SQL for data extraction and Python for data analysis and visualization, actionable insights were derived to optimize underperforming areas, address high drop-off points, and capitalize on peak traffic periods. The project resulted in strategic recommendations aimed at improving user experience and achieving sustainable revenue growth.

# Key Aspects
- **Objective:** Analyze traffic flow and user behavior on an e-commerce platform to uncover patterns, identify inefficiencies, and provide actionable insights for improving engagement and conversions.
- **Methodology:** Unpacked and processed nested data to reveal patterns in user journeys; identified traffic trends, bounce rates, exit rates, and conversion funnels; segmented data by device type, region, and product categories to detect inefficiencies.
- **Tools:** SQL, BigQuery, Python (seaborn, matplotlib).
- **Outcome:** Optimized traffic flow and user engagement, resulting in improved conversion rates, actionable insights, and a scalable framework for ongoing e-commerce performance enhancements.

# Project Insights:
- **Traffic Behavior:** Mobile users had higher exit rates, indicating a need for mobile optimization.
- **Channel Performance:** Referral traffic demonstrated the highest conversion rates, outperforming paid and organic search.
- **Regional Insights:** The America dominated revenue, while Asia and Europe showed growth potential.
- **Product Categories:** Apparel led in revenue, but Electronics and Drinkware showed opportunities for growth.
- **User Behavior:** While 68% of users proceeded to checkout after viewing product details, only 30% completed a purchase, revealing a critical drop-off area.
- **Time Optimization:** Traffic peaked between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m., making it an ideal window for targeted campaigns.
