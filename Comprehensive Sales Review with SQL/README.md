# Comprehensive Sales Review with SQL

### Project Description
In this SQL-based project, I conducted an analysis of sales data for a retail business, focusing on product and brand performance across various categories and regions. Using SQL, I built a series of queries to analyze trends in sales, revenue, and profitability, including monthly comparisons, year-on-year changes, and performance by country and category. By applying advanced SQL functions like window functions and grouping, I identified high-performing products, revenue growth areas, and profit margins for different product categories. This project helped uncover valuable insights into customer behavior, sales dynamics, and business performance, all through SQL analysis.
